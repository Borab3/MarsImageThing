# MarsImageClassifyer about
This program was made for the martion club(link coming soon) that was started in my school([CHS](http://ceh.bvsd.org/Pages/default.aspx)). 
This program takes in 2-6 black and white images of size 256X256. the program will get the dot product of each pixle using the images intensity as the point where the vector is facing in each demintion and comparing that to points on the image that can be selected. 

#Code
